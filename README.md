# Hospital APi
Weâ€™re going to design an API for the doctors of a Hospital which has been allocated by the govt for testing and quarantine + well being of  COVID-19 patients
There can be 2 types of Users
Doctors
Patients
Doctors can log in
Each time a patient visits, the doctor will follow 2 steps
Register the patient in the app (using phone number, if the patient already exists, just return the patient info in the API)
After the checkup, create a Report
Patient Report will have the following fields
Created by doctor
Status :
Can be either of: [Negative, Travelled-Quarantine, Symptoms-Quarantine, Positive-Admit]
